This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying brain tumor MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and PyTorch to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between different types of brain tumors.

#### Project Overview
Brain tumors can be life-threatening and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to aid in the early diagnosis of brain tumors by developing a CNN model that can accurately classify MRI images. The dataset used contains 7023 MRI images labeled into four categories.

#### Key Features
CNN Model Development: Implemented using PyTorch to classify MRI images.
Data Handling and Preparation: Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and data augmentation techniques.
Model Training and Evaluation: Achieved [insert accuracy here]% accuracy on the test dataset.
Performance Visualization: Plotted loss curves and accuracy trends using Matplotlib.
